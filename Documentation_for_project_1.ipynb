        "Data Cleansing and Data Processing Documentation\n",
        "Introduction\n",
        "This document provides an overview of the data cleansing and processing tasks that were completed for an HR dataset. The project involved handling missing values, identifying and addressing outliers, correcting inconsistencies, and visualizing the data to ensure its quality and integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps Taken:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initial Data Loading\n",
        "Objective: The initial dataset was loaded to understand its structure and content.\n",
        "Process:\n",
        "A sample dataset was created, containing employee details such as employee ID, salary, age, department, and hire date.\n",
        "The first few rows of the dataset were reviewed to gain an initial understanding.\n",
        "A summary of the dataset was generated, highlighting the data types and basic statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Handling Missing Values\n",
        "Objective: Missing values in the dataset were identified and addressed.\n",
        "Process:\n",
        "Missing values were identified in the dataset, with particular attention to numerical and categorical columns.\n",
        "For numerical columns, missing values were filled using appropriate statistical measures like mean or median.\n",
        "For categorical columns, missing values were filled using the mode to ensure consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Identifying and Handling Outliers\n",
        "Objective: Outliers within the dataset were visualized and addressed to maintain data integrity.\n",
        "Process:\n",
        "Outliers in the salary data were visualized using a box plot.\n",
        "These outliers were handled by capping the values within a specific range, based on the interquartile range (IQR), to prevent skewed analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Correcting Inconsistencies\n",
        "Objective: Data formats were standardized, and inconsistencies within categorical data were corrected.\n",
        "Process:\n",
        "The date formats across the dataset were standardized for consistency.\n",
        "Categorical data, such as department names, were cleaned and standardized to eliminate inconsistencies, ensuring uniformity across the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Data Visualizations\n",
        "Objective: Various visualizations were created to better understand the relationships and distributions within the data.\n",
        "Process:\n",
        "A scatter plot was used to visualize the relationship between departments and salaries.\n",
        "A pair plot was employed to explore the relationships between key variables, such as salary, department, and age.\n",
        "A correlation heatmap was generated to highlight the relationships between numerical columns, identifying any strong correlations.\n",
        "A count plot was created to display the distribution of employees across different departments.\n",
        "A pie chart was used to represent the proportion of employees in each department, providing a clear visual breakdown.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Ensuring Data Quality and Integrity\n",
        "Objective: The quality and integrity of the data were verified to ensure accurate analysis.\n",
        "Process:\n",
        "A check was performed to verify the existence of a 'tenure' column in the dataset.\n",
        "The data was validated to ensure there were no negative values in the tenure column, maintaining the integrity of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "The data cleansing and processing tasks were successfully completed, resulting in a clean and consistent HR dataset. Through the steps outlined above, missing values were addressed, outliers were managed, inconsistencies were corrected, and various visualizations were created. This comprehensive process ensured that the data was of high quality, ready for analysis and further insights.\n",
